# ✨ Hi there! 👋🏼

I have over 4 years of experience in the tech industry, where I've built digital solutions that are not just functional but also make a real impact. Whether it's developing government websites for millions of users or creating smooth e-commerce platforms, I'm passionate about building technology that is both powerful and inclusive.

## 💼 Professional Experience

**Studio 24 Ltd (over 3 years)**  
For the past few years, I've been part of a great team that builds web applications for some of the UK's most well-known organizations. Working on projects for clients like HS2, the UK Parliament, Kinship, The Fitzwilliam Museum and many more has shown me that good software is more than just code—it's about understanding users and making their lives easier.

I'm especially proud of helping websites reach AAA or AA accessibility standards. This means that people with disabilities can have the same digital experience as everyone else. For me, it's not just about following rules, but about making the web inclusive for everyone.

**intive (5 months)**  
Before joining Studio 24, I did a full-stack internship that helped me build a strong technical foundation. I worked on RESTful APIs and custom e-commerce platforms using tools like Next.js, Express.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript.
